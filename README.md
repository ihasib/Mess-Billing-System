# Mess-Billing-System

This is a real life problem oriented software that we are using in our Mess to ease the total billing issues.

This software takes Different types of charges as input like:
•	Home rent
•	Meal cost
•	Utility costs like electricity, gas, water, servant charge, garage etc.

Summarized result is shown in output (How much one will have to pay per month is part by part shown here, also gross dues are precisely described.)

Input is taken from a “.txt” file. There exists a standard format for the input file. 

The most critical part of this software is that it can adjust with 
•	variable number of boarders
•	variable number of utility costs(e.g. repairing broken taps may be required in one month but not in another)
•	variable number of shopping payments per boarder
